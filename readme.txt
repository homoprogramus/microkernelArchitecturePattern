This is a small piece of code for implementing a plugin architecture in C++.
It is based on the web page https://sourcey.com/articles/building-a-simple-cpp-cross-platform-plugin-system which is also available as a PDF copy in this repos.

Thanks to Kam Low for his version

The signal/slot concept is based on the code of Simon Schneegans presented here https://simmesimme.github.io/tutorials/2015/09/20/signal-slot with a PDF copy present in this repos.
